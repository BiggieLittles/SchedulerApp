This is my schedule app for the duration of the work day from 9am-5pm

This app shows the current time and date down to the second that you click on the page 

When the current time is say 10:45 the box will highlight GREY

When the time is in the past the recent boxes will highlight RED

When the time is coming later in the day the boxes will be GREEN

I used the JUMBOTRON class accompanied by the bootstrap.api in this scheduler app and it helped me organize my HTML a little bit better than the starter code (in my opinion)
